Array: Array is the list of element of the same type placed in a contiguous memory location.

Creating an Array:
dataType arrayName[] = new dataType[size];

Passing arrays as arguments: pass by refernece (changes in array after passing to function will reflect in main function also)

Passing variable as arguments: pass by value (changes in value after passing to function will not reflect in main function)
